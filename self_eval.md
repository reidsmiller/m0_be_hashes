# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Not too much. Seemed pretty self explanatory

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I haven't taken notes yet, but I haven't had a problem yet either. I've discovered that notes don't help me too much -- I think it's just my learning style.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I solved all the problems on my own.
